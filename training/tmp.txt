It seems you are trying to log metadata to (or fetch it from) a run that was stopped (PART-415).

Here's what you can do:
    - Resume the run to continue logging to it:
    https://docs-legacy.neptune.ai/logging/to_existing_object/
    - Don't invoke `stop()` on a run that you want to access. If you want to stop monitoring only,
    you can resume a run in read-only mode:
    https://docs-legacy.neptune.ai/api/connection_modes/#read-only-mode

You may also want to check the following docs pages:
    - https://docs-legacy.neptune.ai/logging/to_existing_object/
    - https://docs-legacy.neptune.ai/usage/querying_metadata/
